# E2E Integration Checklist: Coverage vs Registry

## Purpose
Ensure every major feature has end-to-end (E2E) coverage with:
- deterministic synchronization (avoid fixed sleeps when possible)
- detailed, structured logging
- artifact bundles that make failures diagnosable

This checklist is human-friendly. The enforceable source of truth for what runs
under `--all` is the scenario registry in `scripts/e2e_test.sh`.

## How to use
For each checklist item:
- ensure there is a corresponding E2E case in the registry
- ensure the case runs via the standard runner (`scripts/e2e_test.sh`)
- ensure the case follows the harness contract (`docs/e2e-harness-spec.md`)

If an item is intentionally not E2E-tested (e.g., requires human credentials),
document the reason and provide at least one of:
- fixture-based integration tests, and/or
- a manual smoke-test command with stable output + artifact capture

## Scenario Registry (source of truth)
Registry lives in `scripts/e2e_test.sh` (SCENARIO_REGISTRY). Current entries:
- capture_search
- natural_language
- compaction_workflow
- unhandled_event_lifecycle
- workflow_lifecycle
- events_unhandled_alias
- usage_limit_safe_pause
- notification_webhook
- policy_denial
- graceful_shutdown
- pane_exclude_filter
- workspace_isolation
- setup_idempotency
- uservar_forwarding
- alt_screen_detection
- no_lua_status_hook
- workflow_resume
- accounts_refresh

- [x] E2E: end-to-end usage-limit workflow fixture-first (no real auth). Scenario(s): usage_limit_safe_pause
- [ ] E2E: key failure modes are safe/actionable (MFA required, cannot pick account). Scenario(s): usage_limit_safe_pause (partial: cannot pick account)
- [ ] Artifacts: parsed resume/session info (redacted), next-step plan output. Scenario(s): usage_limit_safe_pause (partial)

#### Compaction (wa-nu4.1.2)
- [x] E2E: compaction detected and handled exactly once per event (dedupe/cooldown). Scenario(s): unhandled_event_lifecycle
- [ ] E2E: injected context is verified (echo/marker). Scenario(s): compaction_workflow (partial; verify marker explicitly)
- [ ] Artifacts: detection evidence, injection payload preview (redacted), verification tail hash. Scenario(s): none

### Phase 3-4: Polish / integration

#### Diagnostics/health/metrics (wa-nu4.3.4)
- [ ] E2E: `wa doctor` healthy vs broken output is actionable. Scenario(s): none
- [ ] E2E: metrics endpoint responds when enabled. Scenario(s): none
- [ ] E2E: watcher health snapshot visible via CLI. Scenario(s): none
- [ ] Artifacts: diag bundle layout + redaction proofs. Scenario(s): none

- [x] E2E: throttling prevents spam. Scenario(s): notification_webhook
- [x] E2E: failure recovery works (network down, endpoint 500). Scenario(s): notification_webhook

#### Timeline/correlation (wa-6sk)
- [ ] E2E: events appear in timeline. Scenario(s): none
- [ ] E2E: correlations are deterministic on fixtures. Scenario(s): none
- [ ] E2E: query performance acceptable under seeded dataset. Scenario(s): stress_scale

#### Quick-fix suggestions (wa-bnm)
- [ ] E2E: suggestions appear on common errors/events. Scenario(s): quickfix_suggestions

- [ ] Artifacts: suggestion IDs fired + dismissal persistence (if applicable). Scenario(s): quickfix_suggestions

## E2E Case Requirements (non-negotiable)
- No fixed `sleep N` synchronization; use wait-for conditions with timeouts.
- All cases write an artifacts directory and print its path on failure.
- Every case prints a PASS/FAIL summary with elapsed time and key assertions.

## Registry Cross-Check
This checklist intentionally references bead IDs (e.g., wa-4vx.4). A validator
should fail if any referenced bead IDs are missing or if scenario names referenced
here are not present in SCENARIO_REGISTRY.

## Notes / Gaps
- Many checklist items currently lack matching scenarios. Use this document to
  drive new scenario beads or add cases to the registry.
- Several existing scenarios likely need stronger assertions and explicit
  artifact capture to fully meet requirements (e.g., delta extraction, dedupe).
